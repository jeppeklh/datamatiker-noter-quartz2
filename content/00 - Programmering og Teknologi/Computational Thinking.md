## Definition 
---
**Computational Thinking** is an approach to problem-solving that involves breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and developing a systematic solution. 

It consists of four key components:


## Decomposition
---
Decomposition involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. 
This makes it easier to tackle each part individually and then combine the solutions to address the overall problem.

#### Example
When designing a video game, you might decompose it into parts like graphics, sound, user input, and game logic.
## Pattern Recognition
---
Pattern recognition is the process of identifying similarities or patterns within the decomposed parts. 
This can help in applying solutions from previously solved problems to new problems.
#### Example
Recognizing that a sorting algorithm used in one program can be applied to another program that requires sorting data.
## Abstraction
---
Abstraction involves removing unnecessary details to focus on the essential aspects of the problem. 
This helps in creating a general solution that can be applied to similar problems.
#### Example
Creating a generic method for sorting that can work with any [[Datatypes|type of data]], rather than a specific method for sorting [[int|integers]] only.
## Algorithm design
---
Algorithm design is about developing a step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a problem. This is akin to writing a recipe that guides you through solving a specific problem.

#### Example
Designing an algorithm for finding the shortest path in a maze.
