> [!tldr] Definition
> A table is a structured set of data held in a [[Repo/00 - Programmering og Teknologi/Languages/SQL/Basics/Database|database]]. 

It consists of rows and columns, where each row represents a unique record and each column represents a specific attribute of the record.

- **Rows**: Also known as records or tuples, they contain the actual data for each entry in the table.
- **Columns**: Also known as fields or attributes, they define the type of data that each row can contain.

## Example

Here's an example of a simple table named `Employees`:

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Position  | Salary |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1          | John      | Doe      | Manager   | 60000  |
| 2          | Jane      | Smith    | Developer | 55000  |
| 3          | Emily     | Johnson  | Designer  | 50000  |
In this table:

- Each row represents a different employee.
- Each column represents different attributes of the employees such as their ID, first name, last name, position, and salary.
