> **Basic Queries** in SQL involve using the [[SELECT]] statement to retrieve data from one or more [[Table|tables]]. 

The [[SELECT]] statement is fundamental to SQL and allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, filter rows using the `WHERE` clause, sort results using `ORDER BY`, and more.

## Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

---

### Example
Retrieve all columns from the "employees" [[Table|table]]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

Retrieve specific columns from the "employees" [[Table|table]] where the department is 'Sales':
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```
