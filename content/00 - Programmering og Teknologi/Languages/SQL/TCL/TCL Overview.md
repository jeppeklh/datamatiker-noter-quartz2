> [!tldr] Definition
> Transaction Control Language (TCL) is a subset of SQL used to manage transactions in a [[Repo/00 - Programmering og Teknologi/Languages/SQL/Basics/Database|database]]. 

TCL commands are used to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data by controlling the transactional behavior. 

Transactions allow a group of SQL statements to be executed as a single unit of work, ensuring that all operations within the transaction are completed successfully before the changes are committed to the [[Repo/00 - Programmering og Teknologi/Languages/SQL/Basics/Database|database]].
