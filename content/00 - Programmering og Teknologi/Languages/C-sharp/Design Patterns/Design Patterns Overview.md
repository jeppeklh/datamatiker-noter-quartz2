> Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. 
> They are best practices that the developer can use to solve recurring problems in the software design. 
> Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

Design patterns are categorized into three main types: 
1. **Creational Patterns**: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. 
2. **Structural Patterns**: These patterns deal with object composition or the structure of classes and objects. 
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: These patterns are concerned with object interaction and responsibility.

## Why Use Design Patterns?
- **Reusability**: Design patterns provide solutions that can be reused across different projects. 
- **Maintainability**: Patterns help in organizing code and make it easier to understand and maintain. 
- **Scalability**: Using patterns can help create scalable solutions by providing a blueprint that can be adjusted to fit different sizes and complexities of projects. 
- **Efficiency**: Patterns provide tested, proven development paradigms which improve coding efficiency and productivity.
