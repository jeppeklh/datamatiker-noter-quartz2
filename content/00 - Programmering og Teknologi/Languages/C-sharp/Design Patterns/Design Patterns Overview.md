## Definition

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. 
They are best practices that the developer can use to solve recurring problems in the software design. 
Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

Design patterns are categorized into three main types: 
1. **Creational Patterns**: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. 
2. **Structural Patterns**: These patterns deal with object composition or the structure of classes and objects. 
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: These patterns are concerned with object interaction and responsibility.

## Why Use Design Patterns?
---
- **Reusability**: Design patterns provide solutions that can be reused across different projects. 
- **Maintainability**: Patterns help in organizing code and make it easier to understand and maintain. 
- **Scalability**: Using patterns can help create scalable solutions by providing a blueprint that can be adjusted to fit different sizes and complexities of projects. 
- **Efficiency**: Patterns provide tested, proven development paradigms which improve coding efficiency and productivity.
