> Custom controls are user-defined controls that extend existing controls or create new ones with additional functionality.

Custom controls are powerful tools for creating sophisticated user interfaces that meet specific requirements. They can be packaged as libraries for reuse and distribution.
## Creating Custom Controls
---
1. **Derive from an existing control**: Create a new class that inherits from an existing control. 
2. **Override methods**: Override methods to customize behavior. 
3. **Add properties and events**: Define new properties and events as needed.

---

## Benefits
- Reusability: Custom controls can be reused across different applications. 
- Encapsulation: Encapsulate complex functionality into a single control. 
- Customization: Tailor controls to meet specific application needs.

---

## Events
- `Click`: Occurs when the button is clicked.

---

## Example
```xml
`<local:CustomButton Content="Click Me" />`
```

---

#### C-Sharp
```csharp
public class CustomButton : Button
{
    protected override void OnClick()
    {
        base.OnClick();
        // Custom behavior
    }
}

```
