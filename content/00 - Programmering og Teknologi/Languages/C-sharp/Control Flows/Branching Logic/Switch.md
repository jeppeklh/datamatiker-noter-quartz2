> Use the `switch` statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

```csharp
int day = 4;
switch (day) 
{
  case 1:
    Console.WriteLine("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    Console.WriteLine("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    Console.WriteLine("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    Console.WriteLine("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    Console.WriteLine("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    Console.WriteLine("Sunday");
    break;
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)
```

## Break
When C# reaches a `break` keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.
When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.

---

## Default
The `default` keyword is optional and specifies some code to run if there is no case match:
```csharp
int day = 4;
switch (day) 
{
  case 6:
    Console.WriteLine("Today is Saturday.");
    break;
  case 7:
    Console.WriteLine("Today is Sunday.");
    break;
  default:
    Console.WriteLine("Looking forward to the Weekend.");
    break;
}
// Outputs "Looking forward to the Weekend."
```
