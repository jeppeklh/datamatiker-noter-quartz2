> [!tldr] Definition
> A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a type by bundling data and methods that work on the data into one single unit. In C#, classes are the foundation of OOP and provide a way to model real-world entities. 

---

## Defining a Class
A class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a pair of curly braces enclosing its members.

---

## Example
```csharp
public class Person
{
    // Field
    private string name;

    // Property
    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; }
    }

    // Method
    public void Greet()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, my name is " + name);
    }
}
```
