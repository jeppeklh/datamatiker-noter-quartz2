## Definition 
--- 
OOP is a programming model organized around [[Objects|objects]] rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. 
[[Objects]] are [[Instantiation|instances]] of [[Classes|classes]], which are templates that define their structure and behavior. 

OOP aims to implement real-world entities like [[Nedarvning|inheritance]], hiding, [[Polymorfi|polymorphism]], etc. in programming. 

## When to Use OOP
---
OOP is used when: 
- You need to model real-world entities and relationships. 
- Code reusability and modularity are essential. 
- Maintaining and managing large codebases is required. 
- You want to implement design patterns effectively.

## Why Use OOP
---
OOP offers several benefits: 
- [[Indkapsling|Encapsulation]]: Bundling data and [[Methods Overview|methods]] that operate on the data within one unit, or [[Classes|class]].
- [[Abstraktion|Abstraction]]: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an [[Objects|object]].
- [[Nedarvning|Inheritance]]: Creating new [[Classes|classes]] from existing ones, promoting code reuse.
- [[Polymorfi|Polymorphism]]: Allowing [[Objects|objects]] to be treated as [[Instantiation|instances]] of their [[Nedarvning#Base class|parent class]], enabling a single [[Abstraktion#Interface|interface]] to represent different underlying forms ([[Datatypes|data types]]).
