A data type specifies the size and type of variable values.

It is important to use the correct data type for the corresponding variable; to avoid errors, to save time and memory, but it will also make your code more maintainable and readable. The most common data types are:

---

- [[string]]
- [[int]]
- [[double]] 
- [[float]] 
- [[decimal]]
- [[char]]
- [[bool]]
