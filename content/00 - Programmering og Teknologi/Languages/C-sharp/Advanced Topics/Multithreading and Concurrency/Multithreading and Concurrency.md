Multithreading and concurrency are concepts that allow applications to perform multiple operations simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness. 

Multithreading involves the concurrent execution of two or more [[Threads|threads]], which are the smallest units of a [[Processes|process]].

Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to manage multiple tasks at the same time, which may or may not be executed simultaneously.
