In C#, [[Delegates|delegates]] and [[Events|events]] are powerful features that enable developers to implement event-driven programming and callback mechanisms. 

[[Delegates]] are like function pointers in [[C]] and [[C++]], but they are type-safe. 

[[Events]], on the other hand, provide a way for a [[Classes|class]] to notify other [[Classes|classes]] or [[Objects|objects]] when something of interest occurs.

[[Delegates]] and [[Events|events]] are commonly used in designing applications with rich user interfaces, where different parts of the application need to communicate with each other based on user actions or other triggers.
